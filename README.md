CuePool is an open-source cue player for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
Build a cue list and step through it with GO, or link cues to run in sequence.

## Features

- **Audio and video** — play sound, video, images, and text from one cue list,
  with fades, loops, and multichannel audio routing.
- **Cue sequencing** — fire cues manually, together, or when the previous cue
  finishes. Use groups and delays to control the sequence.
- **Projection mapping** — map video to multiple outputs with warping
  and edge blending.
- **Lighting** — send DMX over sACN or Art-Net and map video onto LED fixtures.
- **Show control** — use OSC, MIDI, and timecode, or connect through the
  [HTTP API](docs/AUTOMATION.md) and [MCP server](mcp/README.md).

Edit mode is for programming; switch to Show mode to lock cue editing.
Projects are `.qproj` files. Pack a project with its media to take it to another
machine.

## Getting started

Follow the [build instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source) to install
Rust and the platform dependencies, then run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p cuepool
```

The [first-show walkthrough](guide/src/getting-started.md#your-first-show) covers
adding a cue, playing it with **Space**, and saving your project.

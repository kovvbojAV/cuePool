# CuePool — Theatre Show Control

CuePool is a theatre sound, video, and lighting cue player — a
QLab-style show-control app, ported to Rust from
[QPlayer](https://github.com/space928/QPlayer) and renamed CuePool to avoid
confusion with the original project. You build a list of cues (sound, video,
lighting, OSC, …), then fire them one after another with the GO button during
a performance.

Under the hood: audio decode via symphonia with a custom DSP chain on cpal,
video via FFmpeg with GPU YUV→RGB conversion, DMX over sACN or Art-Net, and
OSC / MIDI show control.

Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) to build the app and program
your first show.

## The main window

| Area | What it is |
|---|---|
| Top | Menu bar + transport (GO / Stop / Pause, standby readout, master meter) |
| Left | **Active Cues** — every playing cue with state, volume meter, and a progress bar (`elapsed / total  −remaining`; yellow = paused) |
| Center | **Cue list** — the show, in playback order. The standby cue (what GO will fire) carries a chevron in the left gutter and an outlined row; playing cues are green with a ▶ marker, paused cues amber, idle standby blue |
| Right | **Inspector** — full editor for the selected cue |
| Bottom | Status bar — playing-cue count, mode, cue total, unsaved marker, nonzero **master gain** indicator, and the live **Video** / **Audio** indicators |

Extra panels live in the **Window** menu: Log, Waveform, Video Output,
Projection Mapping, and Lighting.

## Edit mode vs Show mode

The app has two modes. **Edit** mode enables all editing; **Show** mode locks
the cue list so a stray click can't rearrange your show mid-performance.

## Projects

Projects are JSON `.qproj` files (the file format is compatible with the
original QPlayer). While a project is dirty, an autosave thread writes a
backup every 60 seconds, rotating through five slots
(`autoback_1.qproj` … `autoback_5.qproj` in the per-user config directory),
and a crash handler saves `crash_recovery.qproj` on the way down. *File →
Pack…* copies all referenced media next to the project file for touring.

OSC receive/transmit ports and the network interface live in
[Project Settings](show-control.md#osc) (defaults: receive 9000, transmit 8000).

# Getting Started

## Build & run

CuePool needs Rust and native audio/video development libraries. Follow the
[platform setup instructions](https://github.com/kovvbojAV/cuePool/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-from-source),
then run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p cuepool
```

## Command-line options

```text
cuepool [--show-mode] [--zero-copy | --no-zero-copy] [--project <path> | <path>]
cuepool --version
```

`--version` prints the version, source identity and compiled ASIO support, then
exits without opening windows, loading settings or accessing audio devices.
Use it on its own, including while another CuePool instance is running.

Use `--project <path>` or a single positional path to open a project at startup.
When running through Cargo, put app options after `--`:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p cuepool -- --project MyShow.qproj
```

The legacy positional form, `cuepool MyShow.qproj`, remains supported. CuePool
is single-instance: launching a second copy while one is running shows an error
and exits with a nonzero status; it does not forward the project to the running
instance.

`--show-mode` starts the app in Show mode with cue editing locked. The Show/Edit
button still works normally; the flag only chooses the starting mode. Without
it, the app starts in Edit mode.

`--zero-copy` opts into the Windows D3D12VA zero-copy video path;
`--no-zero-copy` forces the stock readback path. The two options are mutually
exclusive. When neither is supplied, the `QPLAYER_ZEROCOPY` fallback is used:
the zero-copy path is enabled only when its value is exactly `1`. Either
command-line option takes precedence over that environment variable.

For separate process profiles and API control, see the
[automation reference](https://github.com/kovvbojAV/cuePool/blob/main/docs/AUTOMATION.md).

## Your first show

1. **New project** — `Cmd/Ctrl+N`, then *File → Project Settings…* to set the
   show title, author, and audio output device.
2. **Add a sound cue** — `Cmd/Ctrl+T`, a toolbar button above the cue list, or
   right-click → *Add Sound Cue*. Pick a file in the Inspector (*File:*).
3. **Shape it** — still in the Inspector: volume (dB), pan, fade in/out
   seconds, and the fade curve. The *Start* / *Duration* fields trim the clip.
4. **GO** — press `Space`. The cue appears in **Active Cues** on the left with
   a meter and progress bar. `Esc` stops everything.
5. **Build a sequence** — set the next cue's trigger to **WithLast** (fires
   together with the previous cue) or **AfterLast** (fires when it finishes),
   optionally with a *Delay*. A single GO then plays the whole chain.
6. **Save** — `Cmd/Ctrl+S` writes a `.qproj` file. *File → Pack…* copies all
   referenced media next to the project file for touring.

## Editing the cue list (Edit mode)

- **Rename / renumber inline** — the `#` and `Name` cells are text fields;
  click and type. Cue numbers commit when the field loses focus (Enter or
  click away; Esc cancels), names commit as you type. Renumbering follows
  references: group members, Stop/Volume/Goto cues targeting the old number,
  and the selection all move to the new number. Duplicate numbers are
  rejected.
- **Add cues** — toolbar buttons above the list, or right-click → *Add … Cue*.
  New cues are numbered after the selected cue by decimal subdivision
  (after cue 1 comes 1.1, then 1.2, …).
- **Right-click menu** — Move Up/Down, Duplicate, Delete, Add cue.
- **Reorder / group** — drag the `≡` handle. Drop a cue onto a Group (or one
  of its members) to join the group — members draw indented under the group
  header. Drop on the strip below the list to ungroup / move to the end.
- **Delete** — right-click → Delete, or select and press Delete/Backspace.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Space | GO (fire the standby cue) |
| Esc | Stop all |
| ↑ / ↓ | Move the standby cue up / down the list |
| Home / End | Standby the first / last cue |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Shift+Z | Undo / Redo |
| Cmd/Ctrl+N / O / S | New / Open / Save project |
| Cmd/Ctrl+T | Add sound cue |
| Cmd/Ctrl+D | Duplicate selected cue |
| Cmd/Ctrl+↑ / ↓ | Move selected cue up / down |
| Delete / Backspace | Delete selected cue |

While a text field has keyboard focus — renaming a cue, editing a Q number —
the field keeps its keystrokes. Only *New*, *Open*, *Save*, *Duplicate* and
*Add sound cue* stay live; the rest resume when the edit ends.

Individual cues can also have their own [hotkey, MIDI, wall-clock, and
timecode triggers](show-control.md#per-cue-triggers).
